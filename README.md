# Advanced recipes for Minetest
This mod contains advanced recipes for the Minetest game.
Tries to fix some conflicts between different mods. The additional recipes are listed below.

The installation of the unified_inventory mod is recommended, because it shows all the available recipes for obtaining a specific output. Alternatively, the `init.lua` file contains all the new recipes and you can look at it to easily understand what these recipes are.

## technic and gemstones
If you installed both the technic and gemstones mods, probably several technic ores
become very hard to find. I discovered that zinc and diamond become basically impossible
to find. For this reason, this mod adds new recipes for obtaining zinc from lead and
diamond from a combination of sapphire and coal.

## rangedweapons and castle
If you installed rangedweapons and castle mods it may be impossible for you to build stone
shurikens. This mod adds a new recipe for stone shurikens.

## flamethrower
If you installed the flamethrower mod, you'll notice that you don't have any recipe for building a flamethrower. This mod adds a recipe for building it.

# Installation instructions
You need to place the `adv_recipes` folder under your `mods` minetest folder. You have two options:

* you clone this repository directly into your mods folder.
* you download the zip file, you uncompress it into the mods folder, and you rename the extracted directory into `adv_recipes` if needed.
